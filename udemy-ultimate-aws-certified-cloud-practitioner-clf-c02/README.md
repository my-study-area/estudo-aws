## Section 3 - What is cloud computing?
9. The difference type of cloud computing

Types od cloud computing:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

Pricing for cloud computing:
- Computer: pay for compute
- Storage: pay for data storage in the cloud
- Data transfer OUT of the Cloud: when the data leaves the cloud. Data transfer IN is free



## Section 4 - IAM - Identity and Access Management
14. IAM Introduction: Users, Groups, Policies

- IAM is a global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared

15. IAM Users & Groups Hands On

Practice on create a user in AWS Console


16. IAM Policies 

Let's say you want to create a policy that allows read-only access to an S3 bucket named "example-bucket":

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username"
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation:

- "Version": Specifies the version of the policy language.
- "Statement": Contains an array of statements, each representing a set of permissions.
- "Effect": Specifies whether the action is allowed or denied. In this case, it's set to "Allow".
- "Action": Indicates the specific action or actions that are allowed. For example, s3:GetObject allows retrieving objects from the bucket, and s3:ListBucket allows listing objects within the bucket.
- "Resource": Specifies the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the resource to which the permissions apply. In this case, it allows access to the "example-bucket".
- "Principal": specifies the IAM user to which the permissions apply. Replace "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username" with the ARN of the IAM user you want to grant permissions to.

This policy grants the specified IAM user ("arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username") permission to list the bucket, get its location, retrieve, upload, and delete objects within the "example-bucket" S3 bucket.

26. IAM Roles for AWS Services

IAM Roles for Services 

- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
- Common roles: 
  - EC2 Instance Roles 
  - Lambda Function Roles 
  - Roles for CloudFormation

27. IAM Roles Hands On

28. IAM Security Tools

IAM Security Tools

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
  - a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
  - You can use this information to revise your policies.

30. IAM Best Practices
- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

31. Shared Responsibility Model for IAM

AWS

- Infrastructure (global
network security)
- Configuration and
vulnerability analysis
- Compliance validation

You

- Users, Groups, Roles, Policies
management and monitoring
- Enable MFA on all accounts
- Rotate all your keys often
- Use IAM tools to apply
appropriate permissions
- Analyze access patterns &
review permissions 

32. IAM Summary
- Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- Groups: contains users only
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
- Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
- Security: MFA + Password Policy
- AWS CLI: manage your AWS services using the command-line
- AWS SDK: manage your AWS services using a programming language
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor

Quiz 2: Identity and Access Management Quiz


## Section 5: EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
33. AWS Budget Setup

34. EC2 Basics

Amazon EC2

- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of :
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 sizing & configuration options 

- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
- How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
- How much random-access memory (RAM) 
- How much storage space: 
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store) 
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
- Firewall rules: security group 
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data 

EC2 User Data
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates
  - Installing software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything you can think of
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

35. Create an EC2 Instance with EC2 User Data to have a Website Hands On

36. EC2 Instance Types Basics

EC2 Instance Types - Overview
- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
- AWS has the following naming convention:

m5.2xlarge

- m: instance class
- 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose

- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
- Balance between:
  - Compute
  - Memory
  - Networking
- In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized

- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
  - Batch processing workloads
  - Media transcoding
  - High performance web servers
  - High performance computing (HPC)
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning
  - Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized

- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
  - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  - Distributed web scale cache stores
  - In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized

- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
access to large data sets on local storage
- Use cases:
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  - Relational & NoSQL databases
  - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  - Data warehousing applications
  - Distributed file systems


37. Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview

Introduction to Security Groups

- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
- Security groups only contain rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups Deeper Dive 

- Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances 
- They regulate: 
  - Access to Ports 
  - Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
  - Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
  - Control of outbound network (from the instance to other

Good to know

- Can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
- It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
- If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Classic Ports to know

- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

38. Security Groups Hands On

39. SSH Overview

Which Lectures to watch 

- Mac / Linux: 
  - SSH on Mac/Linux lecture 
- Windows: 
  - Putty Lecture 
  - If Windows 10: SSH on Windows 10 lecture 
- All: 
  - EC2 Instance Connect lecture

40. How to SSH using Linux or Mac

Example:
```bash
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@38.0.101.76
```
 - `key.pem` is your private key
 - `ec2-user` is the user from your EC2 instance
 - `38.0.101.76` is the IP public address of your EC2 instance

41. How to SSH using Windows

42. How to SSH using Windows 10

43. SSH Troubleshooting

1) There's a connection timeout

This is a security group issue. Any timeout (not just for SSH) is related to security groups or a firewall. Ensure your security group looks like this and correctly assigned to your EC2 instance.

2) There's still a connection timeout issue

If your security group is properly configured as above, and you still have connection timeout issues, then that means a corporate firewall or a personal firewall is blocking the connection. Please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture.

3) SSH does not work on Windows

If it says: ssh command not found, that means you have to use Putty

Follow again the video. If things don't work, please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture

4) There's a connection refused

This means the instance is reachable, but no SSH utility is running on the instance

Try to restart the instance

If it doesn't work, terminate the instance and create a new one. Make sure you're using Amazon Linux 2

5)  Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)

This means either two things:

You are using the wrong security key or not using a security key. Please look at your EC2 instance configuration to make sure you have assigned the correct key to it.

You are using the wrong user. Make sure you have started an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance, and make sure you're using the user ec2-user. This is something you specify when doing ec2-user@<public-ip> (ex: ec2-user@35.180.242.162) in your SSH command or your Putty configuration

6) Nothing is working - "aaaahhhhhh"

Don't panic. Use EC2 Instance Connect from the next lecture. Make sure you started an Amazon Linux 2 and you will be able to follow along with the tutorial :)

7) I was able to connect yesterday, but today I can't

This is probably because you have stopped your EC2 instance and then started it again today. When you do so, the public IP of your EC2 instance will change. Therefore, in your command, or Putty configuration, please make sure to edit and save the new public IP.

44. EC2 Instance Connect

45. EC2 Instance Roles Demo

You need to update the role on your EC2 instance and add a role with the **IAMReadOnly** policy. This will enable you to list users in IAM using the command line `aws iam list-users`.

46. EC2 Instance Purchasing Options

On-Demand

- On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
- Reserved (1 & 3 years)
  - Reserved Instances – long workloads
  - Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
- Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
- Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

EC2 On Demand

- Pay for what you use:
- Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
- All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

EC2 Reserved Instances

- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
- Convertible Reserved Instance
  - Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
  - Up to 66% discount

EC2 Savings Plans

- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across:
  - Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
  - OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
  - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

EC2 Spot Instances

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
  - Batch jobs
  - Data analysis
  - Image processing
  - Any distributed workloads
  - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databas

EC2 Dedicated Hosts

- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
  - On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
  - Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

EC2 Dedicated Instances

- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

EC2 Capacity Reservations

- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

Which purchasing option is right for me?

- On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, …)
- Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
- Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
- Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it


47. Shared Responsibility Model for EC2

AWS:

- Infrastructure (global network security)
- Isolation on physical hosts
- Replacing faulty hardware
- Compliance validation

User:

## Section 6: EC2 Instance storage
49. EBS Overview

What’s an EBS Volume?

- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
- They are bound to a specific availability zone

EBS Volume

- It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
- It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
- An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
- You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
- You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

EBS – Delete on Termination attribute

- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
- By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
- By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
- This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
- Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated

50. About EBS Multi-Attach

About EBS Multi-Attach

While I say that in the previous lecture that EBS volumes cannot be attached to multiple instances, I know it is not true for io1 and io2 volume types: this is called the EBS Multi-Attach feature.

From an AWS Cloud Practitioner exam perspective this out of scope for the exam.
In order to keep the course simple and accessible, I have left out this feature from the course.

If you are curious to learn about EBS Multi-Attach, you will find it in the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course, or in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html).

51. EBS Hands On

52. EBS Snapshots Overview

EBS Snapshots

- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

EBS Snapshots Features

- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  - Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  - Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

53. EBS Snapshots Hands On

54. AMI Overview

AMI Overview

- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
  - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instances from:
  - A Public AMI: AWS provided
  - Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  - An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

AMI Process (from an EC2 instance)

- Start an EC2 instance and customize it
- Stop the instance (for data integrity)
- Build an AMI – this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch instances from other AMIs

55. AMI Hands On

56. EC2 Image Builder Overview

EC2 Image Builder

- Used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or container images
- => Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs
- Can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc…)
- Free service (only pay for the underlying resources)

57. EC2 Instance Store

- EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility 

58. EFS Overview

EFS – Elastic File System

- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
- EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)

- Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
- Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
- EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
- Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
- Example: move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
- Transparent to the applications accessing EFS

59. Shared Responsibility Model for EC2 Storage

AWS:

- Infrastructure
- Replication for data for EBS volumes & EFS drives
- Replacing faulty hardware
- Ensuring their employees cannot access your data

Customer:

- Setting up backup / snapshot procedures
- Setting up data encryption
- Responsibility of any data on the drives
- Understanding the risk of using EC2 Instance Store

60. Amazon FSx Overview
